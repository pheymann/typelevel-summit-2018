            <h3>Define your API on the type-level</h3>
            
            <aside class="notes">
              Some time ago, my colleague David and I were working on a toy project in Haskell which was basically a worker processing messages which it retrieved via HTTP calls.

              He introduced Servant to define these HTTP calls. For everyone not knowing Servant, it is a library which lets you define web apis as types and derives client and server functions from it. At that time I didn't know it either and I was immediately hooked. Servant reduces the code you write to define clients or server to a mere type, it adds extra typesafety and you can use your api types as contracts between a server and its clients.

              At this point an idea formed itself in the back of my head: It would be a nice pet project to implement the same functionality in Scala. But what is the first thing you do before starting a new time sink? Right, you start up your favorite browser and search for solutions already available.

            <h4>lets have an example</h4>

            <pre><code class="scala" data-trim>
              // GET /users/:name?filterByAge=[age] -> List[User]

              final case class User(name: String, age: Int)

            <aside class="notes">
              I will use the following example to ease the understanding of the code that follows. What we try to achieve is to find all users with a given name filtered by their age.

            <h4>what we want</h4>

            <pre><code class="scala" data-trim>
              (name: String, filterByAge: Int) => F[List[User]]
            </code></pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              What we want to end up with is a function which takes the name and age and gives us the list of users.

            <h4>api as a type - path</h4>

            <pre><code class="scala" data-trim>
              // type Path = "users".type - no can do

              val usersW = shapeless.Witness("users")

              sealed trait Path[P]

              type users = Path[usersW.T]
            </code></pre>
            
            <aside class="notes">
              First step is to represent our api as a type. Lets start with the path '/users'. We need to encode that as a type. Unfortunately we just have Vanilla Scala at our hands and literal types aren't a thing, yet. But shapeless has something to overcome this problem called Witness. It forces us onto the value-level but right now that is the only way to get literal types in Scala 2.x. We also add a wrapper type to define it as a path element.

              sealed trait Segment[K, V]

              type name = Segment[nameW.T, String]
            </code></pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              Next comes the segment for the name. Here we label the expected input type String with the segment name.

            <h4>api as a type - query and method</h4>

            <pre><code class="scala" data-trim>
              // query
              val filterW = shapeless.Witness('filterByAge)

              sealed trait Query[K, V]

              type filter = Query[filterW.T, Int]

              // method
              sealed trait Get[A]
            </code></pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              We use the same technique for queries as we did for the segments and, furthermore, add a type to specify the method.

          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>api as a type - put it all together</h4>
            
            <pre><code class="scala" data-trim>
              val Api = api(Get[List[User]],
                            Root / "users" / Segment[String]('name), 
                            Queries.add(Query[Int]('filterByName)))

              // Get[List[User]] :: name :: users :: ... :: HNil
            </code></pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              Now we put all these into a convinient function call and get as result an HList type representing our api. But you will say "hey I don't see a type. You declared a value there.", and you are right. We are still in Scala and, therefore, are not able to work with types as you do with values. To overcome this problem I introduced a type carrier. A simple case class without fields, which carriers the type of the HList.

              <li class="fragment fade-up">elements of our api: <code class="scala">El <: HList</code></li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
              First thing we do with our api type to extract five new types which will come in handy later on. 
                - KIn and VIn are the key and value types of the input fields we expect, e.g. key 'name and value String
                - O and 
                - M represent the output type and the method
                - and El are all the elements of our api, here userW.T :: SegmentInput :: QueryInput :: GetCall :: HNil

              Usually when you try to transform a collection into a new shape you use folds. But how to do the same thing for types?

              And then we construct a recrusive call structure to traverse our api type. Here we look at the current element type of our api and try to find the corresponding aggregation. When this is done the next step is resolved with the new intermediate type. At the end, we just return the latest aggregated type as final result.
