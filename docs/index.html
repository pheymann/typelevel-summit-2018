              Some time ago, my colleague David and I were working on a toy project in Haskell which was basically a worker processing messages which it retrieved via HTTP calls.

              He introduced Servant to define these HTTP calls. For everyone not knowing Servant, it is a library which lets you define web apis as types and derives client and server functions from it. At that time I didn't know it either and I was immediately hooked. Servant reduces the code you write to define clients or server to a mere type, it adds extra typesafety and you can use your api types as contracts between a server and its clients.

              At this point an idea formed itself in the back of my head: It would be a nice pet project to implement the same functionality in Scala. But what is the first thing you do before starting a new time sink? Right, you start up your favorite browser and search for solutions already available.

              Fortunately I couldn't find a promising project on the internets. So far so good. Cancel my weekend plans I have a new item on my agenda.

              And the first step will be to convince Scala to derive a client function from a api defined as type which will also be the main topic of this talk.
